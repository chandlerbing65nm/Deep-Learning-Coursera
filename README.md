## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions for labs and programming assignments on Coursera courses. Certain resources required by the codes may be lacking due to limitations on downloading course materials from Coursera and uploading them to GitHub. The lacking resources are mostly datasets, pre-trained models or certain weight matrices.

The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will help you understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare you to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for you to take the definitive step in the world of AI by helping you gain the knowledge and skills to level up your career.

## Courses
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Deep-Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Deep%20Learning%20and%20Neural%20Networks)

      In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

      By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks;   
      implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
      
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Deep-Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)

      In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good    
      results systematically. 

      By the end, you will learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard 
      neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a 
      variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in 
      TensorFlow.

3. [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Deep-Learning-Coursera#Courses)

      No labs / programming assignments.
      
      In the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will learn how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine 
      learning project leader. 

      By the end, you will be able to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched 
      training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

      This is also a standalone course for learners who have basic machine learning knowledge. This course draws on Andrew Ng’s experience building and shipping many deep 
      learning products. If you aspire to become a technical leader who can set the direction for an AI team, this course provides the "industry experience" that you might 
      otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.
      
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Deep-Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)

      In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as 
      autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

      By the end, you will be able to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual 
      detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. 
      
5. [Sequence Models](https://github.com/chandlerbing65nm/Deep-Learning-Coursera/tree/main/Sequence%20Models)

      In the fifth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will become familiar with sequence models and their exciting applications such as speech recognition, music 
      synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing (NLP), and more. 

      By the end, you will be able to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs; apply RNNs to Character-level Language 
      Modeling; gain experience with natural language processing and Word Embeddings; and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to solve different NLP tasks such as 
      NER and Question Answering.
